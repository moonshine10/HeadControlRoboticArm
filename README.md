# MANO Robotic ARM
MANO robotic arm is a robotic arm designed for quadriplegic patients for their daily activity. It is controlled by head movement and mouth action include sip, puff and bite. It uses various technology such as sensor fusion ( accelerometer, gyroscope , magnetometer) to map users’ head movement and a combination of sensors to map user’s mouse movement.  

# What I did:

I was the embedded system engineer in Human Machine Interface team for MANO project. Our team is responsible for building interface for user to interact with the machine. We come up with the idea of using a head-controlled Bluetooth mouse to control the robotic arm. The head controller will map user head’s pitch and roll movement to control mouse’s movement along X and Y access, and we designed a mouth controller that user can sip, puff and bite on to map right click, left click and scroll. In addition, calibration and sensitivity adjustment was also implemented on the headsets. 

I built the software for our team.
